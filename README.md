This is my first github page as I learn a little python and how I may be able so save my code online.

Currently taking a python class and really liking it. Need to decide whether to do the advanced python class next - or take some HTML/CSS and then Java. Will probably need some SQL at some point. And javascript...

The list just goes on and on. :)
